#Hello guys, For newbies who are just getting started with Python, Here is a very simple code snippet for a working calculator. You can further remodel it ;)

#Take user's input
#Take user's input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number"))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number"))
operation = input("Enter the operation to perform (+,-,*,/,%,^)")

#Now perform the operation requested
if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
         result = num1/num2
    else:
        result = "Error! Division by 0."   
elif operation == '%':
    result = num1%num2 
elif operation == '^':
    result = num1**num2 
else:
    print(operation, " is not valid. Kindly select from the provided operations.")
print("First Number: ",num1)
print("Operator: ",operation)
print("Second Number: ",num2)
print("Result: ",result)
